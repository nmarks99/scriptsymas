# `md2pdf.py`
This script will convert a markdown file to a PDF and format it nicely using latex. In it's current state this is not very portable or user friendly.

## Requirements 
You will need to first install [https://pandoc.org/](pandoc) and a LaTeX compiler. Getting the LaTeX compiler setup and working with pandoc can be a bit annoying and I eventually will write a script to do this reliably and understand how to do it on different OS's. Currently I had this working on Windows with MikTeX and Pandoc but I haven't tried on Linux yet.
